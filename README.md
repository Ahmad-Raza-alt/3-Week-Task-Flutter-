 📱 Flutter Task
Hi there! This is my Flutter project that I worked on for 3 weeks. It's a simple task management app where you can log in, use a counter, manage a to-do list, and add/complete tasks. I built this to improve my skills in Flutter, especially around UI design, navigation, form validation, and saving data locally.

 What This App Can Do

- 👤 Login with basic validation
- 🏡 Home screen to access different features
- ➕ A Counter screen with add and reset functionality
- 📋 To-Do List screen to add and remove tasks
- ✅ Final Task screen where tasks can be added and marked as done
- 💾 Stores tasks using SharedPreferences so they stay even after closing the app
- 🎨 Clean and customized UI theme
  

 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flutter (Dart)**
- SharedPreferences for local storage
- Basic **form validation**
- **State management** using `setState`

| Login             | Form with basic checks              |
| Home              | Buttons to access all other screens |
| Counter           | Add/reset numbers                   |
| To-Do List        | Manage short tasks                  |
| Final Task Screen | Add tasks and mark as done ✅       |

📌 Why I Built This
I wanted to explore Flutter in a more practical way and learn how to connect screens, manage state, validate forms, and save data locally. Every screen in this app helped me practice a different part of app development.
